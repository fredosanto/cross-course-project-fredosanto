Rainy Days is my cross course project that is a part of my 2 year study at Noroff and the project was devided in two parts. First part of the project was in the spring semester and we were to use a HTML and CSS only approach. Second part was in the fall semester were the task was to add JS and use Wordpress REST API with a headless CMS running on a web host and deploy a live version using Netlify.

## Addtitional info

### N.B.

This website doesn't fetch any data from headless REST API. The host used for this website is not available because of subscription. Website will be up and going as soon as I find a new host. So as per now the website won't have any products showing.
